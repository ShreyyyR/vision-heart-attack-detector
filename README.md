#  Vision-Based Heart Attack Detection System
AI-powered system that uses computer vision to detect heart attack symptoms in real time and send emergency alerts.

## 🚀 What the Project Does
This project uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect symptoms indicative of a heart attack in real-time. It analyzes live video streams to recognize facial expressions, body posture changes, and critical motion patterns such as chest clutching or falling. The system raises alerts through SMS or email when a potential emergency is detected.

## 💡 Why the Project is Useful
Heart attacks require immediate medical attention, and timely detection can save lives. This system provides a non-contact, automated monitoring solution that can be deployed in homes, offices, or public areas, enhancing safety and enabling rapid response during health emergencies.
